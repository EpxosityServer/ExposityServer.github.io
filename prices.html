                        Prices ?
                        <br><br>
                        <i>Bro, who want to pay ads ? That useless !</i> We all know this voice.
                        <br>But take a look at this picture:
                        <br>
                        <img src="assets/img/bot-mention.png" alt="Bot mention with members" srcset="" id="bot-mention">
                        <br>
                        If you look at the right, you can see ''Members Count''. It correspond to people who will receive the DM's of the bot, or the @everyone mention if you pay an ads.
                        You can do it on your server to get in real time the members count. You juste have to mention de Exposity bot and see how many people can get your promotion.
                        <br><br>
                        On our server, we think it's a good point to get many members such as more than 10k who can receive the members ads, and we make just a little bit of money on.
                        That's not very expansive, because the DM all is only at 10$. We think it's a nice price to get more members on your Discord server.

                        <i>Ok, ok, you got a point... But how do I pay ?</i>
                        <br>
                        Well, we only accept PayPal money and you can pay by contacting an administrator. There is the Exposity administrators list:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Neufcentonze 你 ejr#3568</li>
                            <li>Imma Hackerman.ejr#7558 (Me)</li>
                        </ul>
                        You can recognize us because we have role named ''Owner''.
                        <br><br>
                        Finally, you can learn more about prices in the ''#Ad-Prices'' channel.
