                        Hello everyone,
                        <br><br>
                        I'm an administrator and the developer of the <a href="https://www.discord.gg/zJbtz3P"
                            target="_blank">Exposity server</a>. I'm talking to you today because I want to show you
                        what's exactly Exposity. First, Exposity is a Discord server which enable you to make your
                        promotion with my bot named <a href="https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=677553964551766037&permissions=268454928&scope=bot" target="_blank">Auto Partners [
                            Exposity ]</a>. If you want to promote your server, you just have to invite him in. Once
                        done, you can type <span
                            style="background-color: rgb(47,49,55); color: white; padding: 2px 5px;">?help</span> to get
                        the commands list. Also, when the bot join, he will create a new channel named partners. If you
                        try to delete it, the bot will recreate it. By the way, if you edit the permissions, the bot
                        will changes the <span style="color: blue;">@everyone</span> and his ones because <span
                            style="color: blue;">@everyone</span> musn't write on, and the bot need some permissions to
                        control his channel.
                        <br><br>
                        Finally, this channel will receive all other promotions from other servers. So, you will get all
                        ads from other ways into your Discord server. But, you will be able to post yours, and all
                        servers which has the bot will receive it.
                        <br><br>
                        In a second time, you can get more visibility if you pay an ad. What do I mean by pay ad ? Well,
                        if you pay us an ad, we will publish your server on a specific channel that everyone can see on
                        Exposity. But there is some changes according to the price. By example, if you want an <span
                            style="color: blue;">@everyone</span> mention, you will have to pay a little bit more that
                        if you don't need this mention. The highest promotion is a DM all. But on more time, what I mean
                        by DM all ? Well, the bot will send a DM with your ad to all members of all guilds where he is.
                        <br><br>
                        You can get the members count who will receive your ads by mentionning the bot.
